Release what's blocking your clarity.
Lead with Emotional Authority, Energetic Presence & Inner Calm

Lead with Confidence. Heal from Within. Unlock Your Peak Potential.

You've worked hard, yet something still feels off. The stress, the self-doubt, the endless striving—it's keeping you from reaching your next level. You're successful, but deep down, you know you're meant for more.

I help high achievers uncover the root causes behind their career struggles—whether it's feeling stuck, unseen, or held back—and guide them through a 360° transformation with deep coaching and healing. When your career aligns, everything shifts. Confidence grows, relationships strengthen, and health improves as a natural result.

Bridge your Soul & Strategy

Research shows 73% of executives experience imposter syndrome [Harvard Business Review, 2021], while 76% of high-performing women report chronic stress affecting their decision-making and leadership presence [American Psychological Association, 2022].

You've built impressive success, but something still feels misaligned. Maybe it's the tension in your chest during meetings, the decision fatigue that follows you home, or the sense that you're performing your life rather than living it.

True leadership isn't about doing more, it's about leading from emotional clarity and energetic congruence.

When you release the invisible patterns driving your stress, overthinking, and people-pleasing, you don't perform better. You lead with calm authority, communicate without second-guessing, and make decisions from inner knowing rather than external pressure.

Unlock Your Peak Performance - Mindset, Energy & Aligned Success

Nearly 70% of leaders say self-doubt and mental blocks limit their ability to make bold decisions, while almost half of executives report that stress impacts their performance, leading to burnout and reactive leadership. Many high achievers unknowingly carry unhealed experiences that shape their career struggles, whether it's fear of visibility, lack of boundaries, or the need to prove their worth.

High performance isn't just about skillset—it's about mindset and energy alignment. When you shift how you think, feel, and lead, success follows naturally.

About Shaveta (JoveHeal) - Agile Mindset Coach

Hi, I'm Shaveta Mehta, an Agile Mindset Coach, expert in subconscious reprogramming, blending energy healing, coaching with Agile tools and concepts to offer a powerful way to elevate your life in all areas.

I work at the intersection of your strategy and soul. After 20 years in corporate leadership, specializing in Agile transformation and executive delivery, I went through my own profound healing journey that changed everything. I discovered that no amount of strategy can fix what's broken at the emotional and energetic level.

Today, I help high-achieving executives and entrepreneurs clear the hidden patterns that keep them stuck in burnout, decision fatigue, and emotional exhaustion. Using a blend of nervous system healing, emotional pattern mapping, and energetic recalibration, I help you lead from wholeness, not just performance.

This isn't therapy or traditional coaching. It's root-level transformation for leaders who are ready to feel as powerful on the inside as their success looks on the outside.

JoveHeal Meaning

JoveHeal isn't just what I do, it's who I am.

During a profound meditation on how to serve leaders at the deepest level, a single word emerged: Jove.

When I discovered its meaning, everything aligned. Jove means Eagle—and throughout my corporate years, colleagues called me "Eagle Eye" because I could spot what others missed during complex product deliveries. Now, instead of identifying system failures, I identify the emotional patterns that limit executive presence.

Jove also represents Jupiter—the planet of expansion and wisdom that governs transformation. In that moment, I understood this work wasn't just a career shift—it was an evolution of the same precision, applied to human potential.

The eagle's ability to see beneath the surface, combined with Jupiter's expansive energy to unlock what's possible. This is why high-performing leaders find clarity in our work that they haven't found elsewhere.

The precision to see your patterns. The wisdom to transform them. The expansion that changes everything.
