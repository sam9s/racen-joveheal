I want you to build a web-chatbot application for a wellness & coaching business (JoveHeal). The chatbot will serve as a front-line information-bot for website visitors.
The primary source of information will be https://www.joveheal.com/

Purpose & Scope (Phase-1 / MVP):

The bot will answer questions related to the services, programs, and general information about JoveHeal (coaching, healing, membership, workshops) based on a knowledge base derived from website content and PDF / document files I will upload.

The bot will not handle bookings, payments, or sensitive personal data yet. It is purely for information-seeking / FAQ / program-details use-cases.

Functional Requirements:

Visitors should be able to open a chat widget on website or a shareable link and type natural-language questions (e.g. “What is the Balance Mastery+ program?”, “Do you have group healing sessions?”, “What are the fees?”, “What is the refund policy?”, “How do I join Inner Mastery Lounge?”).

The bot should respond with answers based on the knowledge base (website text + uploaded documents).

The bot should reference appropriate program names, avoid hallucinations, and indicate if it doesn’t know the answer (instead of making up content).

The bot should support basic conversational flow — follow-up questions, clarifications, and context awareness within a session.

Backend should store minimal logs of conversations (timestamp + user-question + bot-answer) for debugging / review. No user-P-II storage needed in Phase 1.

The app should be deployed on Replit with a stable URL so I can share with client immediately for demo.

Knowledge-Base Ingestion:

I will upload (or link) a set of files: website export (text), PDF brochures, program-detail docs, FAQ docs — these should be ingested by the bot.

The bot should use those as source material for responses (i.e. embed or index them).

Tech & Integration Preferences:

Use Python (or Node.js) backend — whichever Agent chooses.

Use a simple web-chat UI (can be basic, no fancy styling needed).

Use a vector-search + LLM retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach so responses remain grounded in source docs, to avoid hallucinations.

Ensure the code is structured clearly so later we (your dev team) can extend it to full version (booking, scheduling, multi-channel front ends like Instagram / WhatsApp).

Deliverable:

A fully working web link + chat widget.

Clear instructions for how to upload docs & update knowledge-base.

Simple deployment instructions so we can hand over to client for evaluation.

Build the minimal viable product (MVP) for this Phase-1 info-bot.

The Virtual Agent must NOT provide any advice, suggestions, instructions, or interpretations that qualify as medical, psychological, psychiatric, therapeutic, or life-threatening guidance.

A. Zero Medical Advice Policy
The agent must never:
Diagnose any condition (mental or physical)
Suggest treatment, medication, supplements
Recommend stopping or starting treatments

C. Required Safety Redirect Behavior
If a user asks anything that touches:
Extreme emotional pain
Suicidal or self-harm thoughts
Mental health disorders
Physical health/medical issues
Anything requiring licensed professionals
The agent must respond with a safe redirection, such as:
“I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. I’m not able to give medical or mental-health advice, but you deserve real support. Please consider reaching out to a qualified professional or emergency service in your area.”

No matter the situation, it should
✔ Avoid judgment
✔ Stay empathetic
✔ Redirect to professional help
✔ Avoid giving instructions, steps, or treatment advice

D. Content Filters Must Be Enforced
Vendor must ensure:
Strict filtering on keywords (self-harm, suicidal terms, trauma, medication, symptoms)
Automated escalation to human if needed
Logging of high-risk conversations
Immediate stop of conversation when danger is detected
Safety fallback prompts inserted into the AI model

E. Compliance Requirements
The agent must comply with:
Instagram's policies
General AI safety guidelines
No diagnosing, treating, or managing “conditions”
No claims about guaranteed mental transformation or medical benefit
No misleading health statements

F. Allowed Guidance
The agent can provide:
General mindset motivation
Daily routines
Productivity habits
Clarity exercises
Goal-setting prompts
Confidence-building strategies
Mindset inspiration
Non-clinical, general self-improvement suggestions
Everything must stay in the realm of mindset coaching, not therapy.
